# A simple yet effective baseline for 3d human pose estimation
2017-04-04

## abstract
+ goal: understanding error stems from whether limited 2d pose or from a failure to map 2d poses to 3d
+ method: predict 3d positions by 2d joint locations
+ performance: outperform the best reported result by about 30% on Human3.6M
+ conclusion: a large portion of the error of modern deep 3d pose estimation system stems from their visual analysis

## keywords
+ two step method: 
    1. predict 2d pose -- allow to exploit existing 2d pose estimation system
    2. mapping 2d joint locations into 3d space
+ estimation from a single image

## previous
+ 2d to 3d joints: 
    1. using bone lengths
    2. nearest neighbors
    3. RHKS
+ deep-net-based 2d to 3d joints:
    1. stacked hourglass architecture
    2. distance matrix
    3. **this paper** using network regress 3d points from 2d
+ 2d to 3d angular pose


## solution methodology:
+ loss function:

    f = $ \sigma $
