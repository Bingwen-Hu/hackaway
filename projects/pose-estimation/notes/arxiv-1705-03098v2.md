# A simple yet effective baseline for 3d human pose estimation
2017-04-04

## abstract
+ goal: understanding error stems from whether limited 2d pose or from a failure to map 2d poses to 3d
+ method: predict 3d positions by 2d joint locations
+ performance: outperform the best reported result by about 30% on Human3.6M
+ conclusion: a large portion of the error of modern deep 3d pose estimation system stems from their visual analysis

## keywords
+ two step method: 
    1. predict 2d pose -- allow to exploit existing 2d pose estimation system
    2. mapping 2d joint locations into 3d space
+ estimation from a single image
