2018-11-28

## abstract
+ special contribution
    1. estimated 3D poses through 2D keypoints using a **dilated temporal convolutions**
    2. back-projection, a simple and effective semi-supervised training method that leverages unlabeled video data
+ performance
    1. mean per-joint position error: outperform the previous best result by 6mm, error reduction of 11%
    2. significant improvements on HumanEva-1
    3. back-projection method outperforms previous state-of-the-art result in semi-supervised settings where labeled data is scarce

## relate work
+ Two-step pose estimation
    1. before deep learning, most approaches are based on feature engineering and assumptions about skeletions and joint mobility
    2. one step pose estimation
    3. two step pose estimation
        + difficulty: predict accurate 2D poses
+ video pose estimation
    1. single-frame
    2. HoG features of spatio-temporal volumns
    3. learn from 2D keypoint trajectories
+ semi-superivsed training
    1. joint 2D and 3D pose estimation as well as action recognition
    2. unlabeled multi-view
    3. GAN
    4. weakly-supervised approach based on ordinal depth annotations
    5. **this paper** describe poses with detected keypoint coordinates, faster and higher accuracy
