The compoenents of a data-driven machine learning system

1. Data ingestion and storage
2. Data cleansing and transformation

   Part I:
   a. filtering data
   b. dealing with missing incomplete, or corrupted data
   c. dealing with potential anomalies, errors, and outliers
   d. joining together disparate data sources
   e. aggregating data

   Part II:
   a. taking categorical data and encoding it in a numerical representation
   b. extracting useful features from text data
   c. convert numerical data into categorical data to reduce the number of values
      a variable can take on.
   d. transforming numerical features such as applying a log transformation
   e. normalizing and standardizing
   f. feature engineering is the process of combining or transforming the existing 
      variables to create new features.

3. Model training and testing loop
   
   Techs:
   cross-validation
   ensemble methods

4. Model deployment and integration
5. Model monitoring and feedback
