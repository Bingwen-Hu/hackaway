==================== class
only one public class in a single source file.

toString is an important method.

static variable defined in a class is a class-level variable that every instance can see it.

static method cannot directly access instance variable and method, the keyword "this" is not allowed too.

static import make it possible to access static method in a class directly.

variable or method without private, protected or public is considered to have "package access".
package access is rarely used.

private method and variable cannot be accessed by its subclasses.
public and protected can be.
A superclass's protected members can be accessed by members of that superclass, by members of its subclasses
and by members of other classes in the same package.(package-level access)

==================== other
enhance for:
for (type var : vars)
    todo;

java.util.EnumSet : can go through the values of an enum type.
enum is static, final and refered type.

generic class: 
ArrayList<T>

final in Java means constant in C

==================== Java complie
javac -d . Classname.java : when there is a package declaration in Classname.java, this command 
will create the directory and place the .class file in proper place.

javac -classpath .:.. Classname.java : javac will search the current and parent directory for 
.class file 
modify the CLASSPATH environment variable can achieve the same effection.
