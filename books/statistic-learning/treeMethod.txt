Just some notes:

Random forest: we say we have the number of p variable, but everytime we train
a subtree, we use a part of them say m, m < p. Typically, m = sqrt(p)
how many subtrees we need? range from 50 to 500 or so. Using CV can pick up a
approciate number.

Bagging: bagging is similar as random forest, but it use all the variable to
train subtree.

Boosting: a little complex method. sometimes better than random forest.
