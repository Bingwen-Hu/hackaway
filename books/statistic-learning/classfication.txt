In linear regression, the value of y is range from 0 to +Inf, but there are
times when we want our predict fall into [0, 1], usually a probability.

==================== logistic regression ====================
logistic function: f = exp(x) / (1 + exp(x))
here, if there are two variable we have chosed. for example:
y = beta0 + x1 * beta1 + x2 * beta2
we found our model like:
f(beta) = exp(y) / (1 + exp(y)) 
where y = beta0 + x1 * beta1 + x2 * beta2
for every event X we have
p(X) = exp(y) / (1 + exp(y)) as the probability of event X and
p(X) / (1 + p(X))  as the happen ratio of X

==================== LDA ====================
when there are multiclass with multivariable using LDA
LDA assume that for every p sharing the same variance and they are independent
when this assumption are false, LDA is not good. 
QDA is a more complex model than LDA, it has a higher variance and lower bias
compared to LDA
