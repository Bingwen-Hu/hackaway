### set terminology and notation
+ contain(elment): a object belong to a set, say the set contains the object
+ contain(set): all the element in a set belong to another set, say the second set contain the first one.
+ cardinality: number of elements a set contains.
$$ cardinality(A) = |A| $$

usually, *R* denote set of all real numbers, and *C* consists of all complex numbers.

### cartesian product
(named Descartes)

the cartesian product of set A and B is the set of all pairs(a,b) where a->A and b->B
$$ cp(A, B) = A X B $$
$$ |A X B| = |A| X |B| $$
