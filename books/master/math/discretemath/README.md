# Programming and Mathematical Thinking
Some of the mathematics that is most relevant to programming is known as
“discrete mathematics”. This is the mathematics of discrete elements, such as
symbols, character strings, truth values, and “objects” (to use a programming
term) that are collections of properties. Discrete mathematics is concerned
with such elements; collections of them, such as sets and sequences; and
connections among elements, in structures such as mappings and relations.
In many ways discrete mathematics is more relevant to programming than
numerical mathematics is: not just to particular kinds of programming, but
to all programming.
